ReadME Documentation for a Stupid Game:


History:
This was a stupid game.  It's name was even called "Stupid Game".
For some reason people still like it though, and randomly programmers
from PSC are updating it, it's becomming a success.  It was renamed to "Silly Game".

Considering the controversy, how many times this game was updated and how interested people are in it, I suggest we make this a PSC Project
until someone gets code of the month.  If your interested Email
me at Thuganomics69@aol.com

2. Create some graphics for the app
3. A theme and Title would not hurt
4. Smoother scrolling (API would speed up the program)
5. Add a hall of fame
6. Add different skill levels
7. Whatever else you can think of!
8. Future updaters ship this file with the project

Special Note:
This is to Shaun Rogerson.  I hope you don't mind me taking out your
SR's.  If their important to you then I'll put em back, I took em out
because I thought we should make this an ongoing PSC project.


P.S.  I hope some of you guys email me, especially Shaun and Pube! If not then that'll be unfortunate but I'll still update this Game myself and send it to PSC anyway.....(So drop me a line)
